## Webflix - Live Coding Challenge

### Featured Films

1. Fetch the featured film from the remote api at `src/pages/api/featured`
2. Store the featured film on the database every time we fetch it. (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
3. Render the featured film on the landing page and implement the basic [Figma UI](https://www.figma.com/design/8IrWHW2aUQZN6ILycX6ug7/Liteflix-Challenge?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas)

To handle the endpoint's images correctly, please refer to the developer documentation: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-basics

### Popular Films

### Evaluation
- Communication: how fluidly you express ideas and communicate while coding.
- Problem Solving: how you overcome obstacles consistently.
- Code Fluency: how quickly, correctly and idiomatically you write code to fulfill requirements.

#### Tips & Tricks
- We want to see an implementation as pixel perfect as possible.
- The project uses Next.js Pages & Prisma. Leveraging its specific features is available but not required
- You may consult outside sources like documentation, web search or AI but absolutely cannot copy-paste code of any sort.

This project uses next.js pages, prisma & sqlite.

You can view the database with
```
npx prisma studio
```
Documentation for Prisma is viewable at https://www.prisma.io/docs
